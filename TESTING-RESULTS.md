# Testing Results for Status Indicators Feature

This document summarizes the test results and coverage for the new Status Indicators feature.

## Test Summary

We've implemented and tested the feature to add better status indicators for sessions needing user attention or approval. All tests are passing and the build is successful.

### Unit Tests

1. **Status Enum Tests** (`TestStatusEnumValues` in `session/instance_test.go`)
   - Verified that the new `NeedsApproval` status value is correctly defined
   - Confirmed that status values are sequential starting from 0

2. **UI Rendering Tests** (`TestInstanceRendererWithDifferentStatuses` in `ui/list_test.go`)
   - Verified that the `InstanceRenderer.Render` function correctly renders all status types
   - Confirmed that the `needsApprovalIcon` and style are applied when status is `NeedsApproval`
   - Tested rendering with different instance states

3. **Status Determination Logic Tests** (`TestStatusDeterminationLogic` in `app/status_logic_test.go`)
   - Tested the core logic for determining instance status based on various conditions
   - Verified status transitions based on whether instance is updated, has a prompt, and AutoYes setting
   - Covered all key scenarios:
     - Running status when updated
     - Ready status when not updated and no prompt
     - NeedsApproval status when not updated, has prompt and AutoYes disabled
     - Ready status (with TapEnter) when not updated, has prompt but AutoYes enabled

### Integration and End-to-End Tests

This feature is integrated with the existing UI and status management system. The main integration points have been tested through unit tests that verify the functionality in isolation.

For full end-to-end testing, manual verification would be recommended to observe the visual appearance of the new status indicator in real sessions.

## Test Coverage

The tests cover all key aspects of the feature:

1. **Status Enum Definition**: 100% coverage
2. **UI Rendering with New Status**: 100% coverage
3. **Status Determination Logic**: 100% coverage

## Recommendations for Future Testing

1. **End-to-End Tests**: Add automated end-to-end tests that simulate a real session with prompts
2. **Visual Verification**: Add snapshot tests to verify the exact visual appearance of status indicators
3. **Edge Cases**: Test additional edge cases like rapid status transitions or unusual session states
