# Upstream Analysis Update Process

## Overview

This document outlines the recommended process for regularly updating the upstream fork analysis. By following this process, the Claude Squad project can stay informed about valuable contributions from the community.

## Update Schedule

It's recommended to perform an upstream analysis update:

1. Monthly for regular maintenance
2. Before planning a major release
3. When seeking specific features or fixes that might exist in forks

## Update Process

### 1. Update the Fork List

Refresh the list of forks by querying GitHub's API:

```bash
# Example using GitHub CLI
gh api repos/smtg-ai/claude-squad/forks --paginate > forks-list.json
```

Or visit: https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/network

### 2. Identify Changed Forks

For each fork, compare with the main branch to identify those with new commits:

```bash
# Example using GitHub's comparison view
# Visit for each fork:
https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/compare/main...{username}:main
```

### 3. Analyze New Contributions

For forks with new commits:

1. Review the commit history and messages
2. Analyze code changes to understand the nature and impact
3. Test the fork locally if the changes are substantial

### 4. Update Documentation

For each fork with valuable contributions:

1. Update existing analysis documents or create new ones
2. Document key features, fixes, and potential benefits
3. Update the README.md with summary information

### 5. Create Integration Tickets

For promising contributions:

1. Create GitHub issues for features/fixes to consider integrating
2. Link to the relevant fork and analysis document
3. Tag with appropriate labels (e.g., `upstream-feature`, `enhancement`, `bugfix`)

## Automation Opportunities

Consider automating parts of this process:

1. Use GitHub Actions to periodically check for forks ahead of main
2. Create a script to generate comparison summaries
3. Implement automated testing of fork branches

## Conclusion

Regular updates to the upstream fork analysis help the Claude Squad project benefit from community contributions while maintaining control over what gets integrated into the main codebase. This process provides a structured approach to identifying and evaluating potential improvements from forks.
