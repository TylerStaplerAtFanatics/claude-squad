# Claude Squad Upstream Integration Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for analyzing and integrating changes from forks of the Claude Squad repository. It outlines a methodology for identifying valuable contributions and the process for incorporating them back into the main branch.

## Analyzing Forks

### Step 1: Identify Active Forks

To find forks with potential valuable contributions:

1. Use GitHub's fork network: `https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/network`
2. Check fork comparison pages: `https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad/compare/main...{username}:main`
3. Look for forks with recent activity or significant commit counts ahead of main

### Step 2: Evaluate Contributions

For each fork ahead of main:

1. Analyze the commit history to identify new features or fixes
2. Review code changes to assess quality and compatibility
3. Categorize changes (e.g., bug fixes, new features, refactoring)
4. Consider the value each change brings to the project

### Step 3: Documentation

Document findings for each promising fork:

1. Create a markdown file with fork details
2. List key contributions and potential benefits
3. Note any concerns or integration challenges

## Integration Process

### Preparing for Integration

1. Create a new branch from main for integrating changes
2. Add the fork as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add fork-name https://github.com/{username}/claude-squad.git
   git fetch fork-name
   ```

### Cherry-Picking vs. Merging

For selective feature integration:
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

For complete feature sets:
```bash
git merge --no-ff fork-name/main
```

### Testing Integrated Changes

1. Run the full test suite
2. Verify functionality in both standard and simple modes
3. Check compatibility with all supported AI agents

### Pull Request Creation

1. Create a detailed PR describing the integrated changes
2. Reference the original fork and contributors
3. Highlight any modifications made during integration

## Recommendations

When considering which changes to integrate:

1. **Prioritize bug fixes** that address known issues
2. Focus on features that align with the project roadmap
3. Consider user impact and potential for improving experience
4. Be cautious with changes that introduce significant dependencies

## Conclusion

Regular reviews of forks can identify valuable contributions that enhance Claude Squad. By following this structured approach, the project can benefit from community improvements while maintaining code quality and consistency.
